# ButtonKit

ButtonKit provide two SwiftUI buttons to deal with throwable and asynchronous actions.
By default, SwiftUI button only accept a closure.

With ButtonKit, you'll have access to:
- `ThrowableButton`, accepting a `() throws -> Void` closure
- `AsyncButton`, accepting a `() async throws -> Void` closure

## Requirements

- Swift 5.9+ (Xcode 15+)
- iOS 15+, iPadOS 15+, tvOS 15+, watchOS 8+, macOS 12+, visionOS 1+

## Installation

Install using Swift Package Manager

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Dean151/ButtonKit.git", from: "0.1.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ButtonKit", package: "ButtonKit"),
    ]),
]
```

And import it:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import ButtonKit
```

## Usage

### Throwable

Use it as any SwiftUI button, but throw if you want in the closure:

```swift
ThrowableButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
```

When the button closure throws, the button will shake by default

For now, only this shake behavior is built-in:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/shake.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.throwableButtonStyle(.shake)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can disable still it by passing `.none` to throwableButtonStyle:

```swift
ThrowableButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.throwableButtonStyle(.none)
```

You can also bring your own behavior using the `ThrowableButtonStyle` protocol.

In ThrowableButtonStyle, you can implement `makeLabel`, `makeButton` or both to alterate the button look and behavior.

```swift
public struct TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle: ThrowableButtonStyle {
    public init() {}

    public func makeLabel(configuration: LabelConfiguration) -> some View {
        if configuration.errorCount > 0 {
            Text("Try again!")
        } else {
            configuration.label
        }
    }
}

extension ThrowableButtonStyle where Self == TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle {
    public static var tryAgain: some ThrowableButtonStyle {
        TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle()
    }
}
```

Then, use it:
```swift
ThrowableButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.throwableButtonStyle(.tryAgain)
```

### Asynchronous

Use it as any SwiftUI button, but the closure will support both try and await.

```swift
AsyncButton {
    try await doSomethingThatTakeTime()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
```

When the process is in progress, another button press will not result in a new Task being issued. But the button is still enabled and hittable.
You can disable the button on loading using `disabledWhenLoading` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.disabledWhenLoading()
```

You can also disable hitTesting when loading with `allowsHitTestingWhenLoading` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.allowsHitTestingWhenLoading(false)
```

Access and react to the underlying task using `asyncButtonTaskStarted` or `asyncButtonTaskEnded` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.asyncButtonTaskStarted { task in
    // Task started
}
.asyncButtonTaskEnded {
    // Task ended or was cancelled
}
```

You can summarize both using `asyncButtonTaskChanged` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.asyncButtonTaskChanged { task in
    if let task {
        // Task started
    } else {
        // Task ended or was cancelled
    }
}
```

While the progress is loading, the button will animate, defaulting by replacing the label of the button with a `ProgressIndicator`.
All sort of styles are built-in:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/overlay.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/pulse.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.overlay)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.pulse)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/leading.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/trailing.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.leading)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.trailing)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can disable this behavior by passing `.none` to `asyncButtonStyle`
```swift
AsyncButton {
    try await doSomethingThatTakeTime()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.asyncButtonStyle(.none)
```

`AsyncButton` also support throwableButtonStyle modifier.

You can also build your own customization by implementing `AsyncButtonStyle` protocol.

Just like `ThrowableButtonStyle`, `AsyncButtonStyle` allow you to implement either `makeLabel`, `makeButton` or both to alterate the button look and behavior while loading is in progress.

You can control the size of the `ProgressView` inside `AsyncButton` using the `asyncButtonProgressViewSize` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.asyncButtonProgressViewSize(.small)
```
On macOS, you'll likely want to use the `.small` variant to match the standard system button.

### Asynchronous Determinant Progress

```swift
AsyncProgressButton { progress in
    progress.send(0.3)
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 3_000_000_000)
    progress.send(0.7)
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 3_000_000_000)
} label: {
    Text("Process")
}
```

`AsyncProgressButton` receives a parameter `CurrentValueSubject<Double>` that you can send values `0.0...1.0`. 

You can control the color of the progress indicator using `.asyncButtonProgressColor`.

```swift
AsyncProgressButton { progress in
    ...
}
.asyncButtonProgressColor(.white)
```
