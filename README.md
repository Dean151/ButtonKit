# ButtonKit

ButtonKit provides a new a SwiftUI Button replacement to deal with throwable and asynchronous actions.
By default, SwiftUI Button only accept a closure.

With ButtonKit, you'll have access to an `AsyncButton` view, accepting a `() async throws -> Void` closure.

## Requirements

- Swift 5.9+ (Xcode 15+)
- iOS 15+, iPadOS 15+, tvOS 15+, watchOS 8+, macOS 12+, visionOS 1+

## Installation

Install using Swift Package Manager

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Dean151/ButtonKit.git", from: "0.3.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ButtonKit", package: "ButtonKit"),
    ]),
]
```

And import it:
```swift
import ButtonKit
```

## Usage

### Throwable

Use it as any SwiftUI button, but throw if you want in the closure:

```swift
AsyncButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
```

When the button closure throws, the button will shake by default

For now, only this shake behavior is built-in:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/shake.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.throwableButtonStyle(.shake)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can still disable it by passing `.none` to throwableButtonStyle:

```swift
AsyncButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.throwableButtonStyle(.none)
```

You can also bring your own behavior using the `ThrowableButtonStyle` protocol.

In ThrowableButtonStyle, you can implement `makeLabel`, `makeButton` or both to alter the button look and behavior.

```swift
public struct TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle: ThrowableButtonStyle {
    public init() {}

    public func makeLabel(configuration: LabelConfiguration) -> some View {
        if configuration.errorCount > 0 {
            Text("Try again!")
        } else {
            configuration.label
        }
    }
}

extension ThrowableButtonStyle where Self == TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle {
    public static var tryAgain: TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle {
        TryAgainThrowableButtonStyle()
    }
}
```

Then, use it:
```swift
AsyncButton {
    try doSomethingThatCanFail()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.throwableButtonStyle(.tryAgain)
```

### Asynchronous

Use it as any SwiftUI button, but the closure will support both try and await.

```swift
AsyncButton {
    try await doSomethingThatTakeTime()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
```

When the process is in progress, another button press will not result in a new Task being issued. But the button is still enabled and hittable.
You can disable the button on loading using `disabledWhenLoading` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.disabledWhenLoading()
```

You can also disable hitTesting when loading with `allowsHitTestingWhenLoading` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.allowsHitTestingWhenLoading(false)
```

Access and react to the underlying task using `asyncButtonTaskStarted` or `asyncButtonTaskEnded` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.asyncButtonTaskStarted { task in
    // Task started
}
.asyncButtonTaskEnded {
    // Task ended or was cancelled
}
```

You can summarize both using `asyncButtonTaskChanged` modifier.
```swift
AsyncButton {
  ...
}
.asyncButtonTaskChanged { task in
    if let task {
        // Task started
    } else {
        // Task ended or was cancelled
    }
}
```

While the progress is loading, the button will animate, defaulting by replacing the label of the button with a `ProgressView`.
All sort of styles are built-in:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/overlay.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/pulse.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.overlay)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.pulse)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/leading.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/trailing.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.leading)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.trailing)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can disable this behavior by passing `.none` to `asyncButtonStyle`
```swift
AsyncButton {
    try await doSomethingThatTakeTime()
} label {
    Text("Do something")
}
.asyncButtonStyle(.none)
```

You can also build your own customization by implementing `AsyncButtonStyle` protocol.

Just like `ThrowableButtonStyle`, `AsyncButtonStyle` allows you to implement either `makeLabel`, `makeButton` or both to alter the button look and behavior while loading is in progress.

### External triggering

You might need to trigger the behavior behind a button with specific user actions, like when pressing the "Send" key on the virtual keyboard.

Therefore, to get free animated progress and errors behavior on your button, you can't just start the action of the button by yourself. You need the button to start it. 

To do so, you need to set a unique identifier to your button:

```swift
enum LoginViewButton: Hashable {
  case login
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        AsyncButton(id: LoginViewButton.login) {
            try await login()
        } label: {
            Text("Login")
        }
    }
}
```

And from any view, access the triggerButton environment:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.triggerButton)
    private var triggerButton
    
    ...
    
    func performLogin() {
        triggerButton(LoginViewButton.login)
    }
}
```

Note that:
- The button **Must be on screen** to trigger it using this method.
- If the triggered button is disabled, calling triggerButton will have no effect
- If a task has already started on the triggered button, calling triggerButton will have no effect

### Deterministic progress

AsyncButton supports progress reporting:

```swift
AsyncButton(progress: .discrete(totalUnitCount: files.count)) { progress in
    for file in files {
        try await file.doExpensiveComputation()
        progress.completedUnitCount += 1
    }
} label: {
    Text("Process")
}
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
.buttonBorderShape(.roundedRectangle)
```

`AsyncButtonStyle` now also supports determinate progress as well, responding to `configuration.fractionCompleted: Double?` property:

```swift
AsyncButton(progress: .discrete(totalUnitCount: files.count)) { progress in
    for file in files {
        try await file.doExpensiveComputation()
        progress.completedUnitCount += 1
    }
} label: {
    Text("Process")
}
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
.buttonBorderShape(.roundedRectangle)
.asyncButtonStyle(.trailing)
```

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/determinant-bar.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/determinant-percent.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.overlay)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.overlay(style: .percent))</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/Preview/determinant-leading.gif" width="250"></td>
        <td><img src="/Preview/determinant-trailing.gif" width="250"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.leading)</td>
        <td>.asyncButtonStyle(.trailing)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can also create your own progression logic by implementing the `TaskProgress` protocol. 
This would allow you to build logarithmic based progress, or a first step that is indeterminate, before moving to a deterministic state (like the App Store download button)

Available TaskProgress implementation are:
- Indeterminate, default non-determinant progress with `.indeterminate`
- Discrete linear (completed / total) with `.discrete(totalUnitsCount: Int)`
- Estimated progress that fill the bar in the provided time interval, stopping Ã  85% to simulate a determinant loading with `.estimated(for: Duration)`
- (NS)Progress bridge with `.progress`
